# Chapter 1

## 1.2

Let `x = p_1 * p_2 ... p_n` and `y = x * p_(n-1)`. It satisifies `x < y` and `f(x) > f(y)`.

For example, `x = 2 * 3 = 6` and `y = 2 * 3 * 2 = 12`.

## 1.3

If x is an integer, `floor(x) == ceil(x)`.

Otherwise, suppose `x = m + p/q`, in which x, m, p and q are integers and `p < q`. We have `floor(x) = m` and `ceil(x) = m + 1`, which meets the requirement.

## 1.4

First, let's consider the simplest situation in which there are three pigeonholes in a row: `[ 1 | 2 | 3 ]`. Obviously pigeon 1 and 3 have to occpuy hole 2. If we mark hole 1 and 3 as white and hole 2 as black, the flying rule requires that pigeons must enter a hole that has a different color from its starting point: from white to black, and vice versa. There is a map between two sets: `Leave_White --> Enter_Black`. Since `Leave_White` has 2 members and `Enter_Black` has only 1, the Pigeonhole Principle stats that there are 2 pigeons in one black hole.

Generally speaking, when there are `2k + 1` holes in a row and we use the same color pattern as above (white-black-white), there are `k + 1` white holes and `k` black ones, the conclusion holds.

If we have a chessboard that has `(2k + 1) * (2k + 1)` grids, and we tint the `2i + 1`th row as `white-black` and the `2i`th row as `black-white`, we can guarantee that grids adjacent to each other have different colors. So the map from `Leave_White` to `Enter_Black` is still vaild. If there are only `2k` rows, the number of white and black grids shall be the same. However, on the `2k + 1` row, there are `k + 1` white grids and `k` black ones. Once again, we have one more white hole than black. This leads to the same conclusion as we have discussed in the first case.

## 1.5

The problem implies that we need two sets. Set P includes every people in a group and set N lists all the number of friends. A map from P to N links a person to his or her number of friends. Now we need to prove that set P has more elements than N.

Since one cannot be a friend of himself, the maximum possible integer in N is `p - 1`. We use p to refer the size of P. In this case, the minimum possible element of N is 1. Because friendship is symmertrical. If Tom is everyone's friend, then everyone except Tom has at least 1 friend. So the size of N is `p - 1`.

If the maximum number in N is `p - k`, where k is an integer greater than 1, then the minimum number is 0. The size of N is `p - k + 1`. Because `p - 1 >= p - k + 1` when `k >= 2`, `p - 1` is the maximum possible size of N.

The Pigeonhole Principle stats that for such a map from P to N, in which P has `p` elements and N has at most `p - 1` elements, there are at least 2 `p`s mapped to the same `n`, which means two people have the same number of friends.

## 1.6

We select two points and draw a crossing line that separates the sphere into two parts. If none of the remaining points lie on the equator, then we need to put three points into two open hemisphere. One of the hemisphere must contain at least two points. This open hemisphere along with the equator satisfies the requirement. If the equator passes through three or more points, the conclusion remains unchanged.

## 1.7

Let set P contains 25 people and set B contains 12 months. Since `25 > 12 * 2`, at least 3 people are born on the same month.

## 1.8

Let set C contains unknowns amout of coins. Each coin has a unique ID and one of six denominations. Let set D contins six denominations. In order to guarantee that at least `k + 1` coins have the same denomination, it requires that `size(C) > k * size(D)`. Since `k = 99, size(D) = 6`, it turns out that `size(C) = 99 * 6 = 594`. We need a collcetion of 594 coins.

## 1.9

Let set P contains 25 people and set S contains 3 colorful shirts. Because `25 > 3 * 8`, at least 9 people are wearing the same color. We make another map from these 9 people to 8 classes. Since `9 > 8 * 1`, it turns out that at least two people who wear the same color and are in the same class.

## 1.10

First let's consider a simpler case. Let the first integer be 1 and the last be 60. Next we cut a stick of length 60 into 3 parts. Because we can rearrange and join these parts freely, it is safe to suppose that the left most part is the shortest. As shown in the diagram below, `l, m and n` are integers and `m and n` are not lesser than 0.

    |-------|-------|-----------|
    1   l     l + m   l + m + n 60

We have `l + (l + m) + (l + m + n) = 59`. If both `m and n` are 0, `l` cannot be greater than 19. This shows that if we choose 1, 60 and two distinct integers between 1 and 60, the difference between some two of them is not greater than 19.

If the minimum number is greater than 1 and lesser than 19, `l` becomes smaller. The conclusion mentioned above still holds.

## 1.11

Unsolved.

## 1.12

The conclusion seems invalid. Consider such a set, {7, 7^2, 7^3, ..., 7^9}. The prime factor between any two of them is 7, which is greater than 5.

## 1.13

Since a string is mapped to one and only one hash value, the possible hash values `p` cannot be greater than the number of strings `m`. In other words, `p <= m`.

If `p` is 1, all strings are mapped to the same hash value. The maxium number of collisions in this case is `m - 1`.

Otherwise, let `k = ceil(m / p)`, the Extended Pigeonhole Principle states that at least `k` strings have the same hash value. The minimum number of collisions is `k - 1`.
