# Chapter 22

## 22.1

### (a)

Alphabet a can be shifted at most 25 steps. So there are 25 different ciphers.

### (b)

Every alphabet has 26 replacements. So there are 26^2 different ciphers.

### (c)

5^2*21^2 = 11025

## 22.2

### (a)

    4*3*5 = 60

### (b)

    4*3*5-2*1*5 = 50

## 22.3

### (a)

8!

### (b)

    MISSISSIPPI: {<M, 1>, <I, 4>, <S, 4>, <P, 2>}

    \frac{11!}{4!*4!*2!} = 34650

## 22.4

Suppose there are N permutations that none of them can be transformed by rotation and/or reversal to another. For every permutation, there are 5 transformed arranagements. Since N*5 = 5!, we have N = 24.

## 22.5

    \frac{15!}{5!*5!*5!} = 756756

## 22.6

The last digit has 5 candidates (0, 2, 4, 6, 8). Each of the remaining three digits has 9 candidates. However, we should exclude the situation that the leading digit is zero.

    9*9*9*5 - 9*9*5 = 3240

## 22.7

### (a)

    (26*2+10)^8 = 62^8

### (b)

No numerals:

    (26*2)^8 = 52^8

No lowercase or uppercase letters:

    (26+10)^8 = 36^8

### (c)

    62^8*10^{-9}/3600 ~ 60.7 hours

### (d)

Suppose the length is n.

    \frac{26^n*10{-9}}{3600} = 60.7
    n = 11
