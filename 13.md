# Chapter 13

## 13.1

b -> c -> c -> d

## 13.2

When d_G(u, w) = 0, there are two cases. If u = w = v, the equation holds. If u = w != v, d_G(u, v) > 0 and d_G(v, w) > 0, so the inequation holds.

Now consider these two paths:

    u -> p -> q -> w
    p -> v -> q

According to hyphothesis, d_G(p, q) <= d_G(p, v) + d_G(v, q), therefore

    d_G(u, w)
    = d_G(u, p) + d_G(p, q) + d_G(q, w)
    <= d_G(u, p) + d_G(p, v) + d_G(v, q) + d_G(q, w)
    = d_G(u, v) + d_G(v, w)

### (a)

        in  out
    a   1   2
    b   1   2
    c   2   2
    d   2   2
    e   2   0

### (b)

Cycles of G:

    a -> c -> d -> b -> a
    b -> c -> d -> b
    a -> d -> b -> a

There is no cycle that passes through each vertex because the out degree of vertex e is 0.

### (c)

    aa 0    ba 1    ca 3    da 2    ea \infinite
    ab 2    bb 0    cb 2    db 1    eb \infinite
    ac 1    bc 1    cc 0    dc 2    ec \infinite
    ad 1    bd 2    cd 1    dd 0    ed \infinite
    ae 2    be 2    ce 1    de 1    ee 0

### (d)

The length of the longest path is 4.

    a -> c -> d -> b -> a
    c -> d -> b -> a -> c
    d -> b -> a -> c -> d
    b -> a -> c -> d -> b

## 13.4

None of them contains a nontrivial cycle.

## 13.5

### (a)

* 51 -> 182
* 121 -> 182
* 20 -> 121
* 50 -> 124
* 51 -> 124
* 121 -> 124
* 110 -> 124
* 50 -> 51
* 51 -> 61

### (b)

There are no nontrival cycles in this graph, so it is a DAG.

If two or more courses form a cycle, you cannot take any one of them.

### (c)

3 semesters. The longest path is 50 -> 51 -> 182 and 20 -> 121 -> 182. Here is a possible assignment:

* Semester 1: 50, 20, 110, 61.
* Semester 2: 51, 121.
* Semester 3: 182, 124.

## 13.6

For a digraph of one vertex, the sum of the in-degrees and the sum of out-degrees are 0.

Now consider adding a new vertex n to a existing graph. Whenever we form a new arc from n to a vertex v, the out-degree of n increases by 1 and the in-degree of v also increases by 1. Similarly, both the out-degree of v and the in-degree of n increases by 1 if we form an acr from v to n. This shows that the statement hold true for any digraph.

## 13.7

### (a)

The minimum number is n-1. The digraph contains only one cycle which includes all vertices. For a digraph with three vertices, a triangle connection has the minimum arcs. Next let's add a new vertex n to a existing digraph. Since the new digraph has to be strongly connected, there are two solutions.

Connect n to a vertex p and from a vertex q. This results in two more arcs.

Suppose there are two adjacent vertices: p -> q. We insert n inbetween them:

    p -> v -> q

This results just one more arcs and the digraph is strongly connected. Now we can n+1 vertices and n arcs, so the statement is proved to be true.

### (b)

The maximum distance is n-1.
