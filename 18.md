# Chapter 18

## 18.1

The graph has a 3-colorable.

    1:r, 3:g, 5:r, 4:g, 2:b
    6:g, 8:b, 7:g

We can replace any vertex with a fourth color.

2-5-4 is an odd length cycle, so 2-coloring cannot exist.

## 18.2

The chromatic number is n-1. In a complete graph, every vertex must have a different color from all other vertices. Suppose an edge connects two vertices, red and green. By removing the edge, we can re-color the green vertex with red, and the original red vertex remains unchanged. This shows that we need n-1 colors for a K_n - e graph.

## 18.3

The chromatic number is 2. Add up every vertex's i and j. If the sum is even, color the vertex with white, otherwise color it with black. Every vertex is adjacent to at most four neighbors. There are four combinations of i and j and they belong to two groups:

Group 1: i = 2m, j = 2n; or i = 2m+1, j = 2n+1.

The sum of i+j is even, and the combination of i and j for all its neighbors belong to the second group.

Group 2: i = 2m+1, j = 2n; or i = 2m, j = 2n+1.

The sum of i+j is odd, and the combination of i and j for all its neighbors belong to the first group.

Therefore there only exists two types of vertices in the graph.

## 18.4

### (a)

Let n=2k. We can draw an isomorphic graph of two nested polygons. Each polygon has k vertices. Label the outer polgon with odd numbers, and the inner with even numbers. Connect these two polygons to form a cycle: 1-2-3-... . No edges are crossed in this graph. According to the Four-Color Theorem, such a planar graph is 4-colorable.

### (b)

If there are infinite vertices, we can color each of them with one of three colors:

    1:r, 2:g, 3:b,
    4:r, 5:g, 6:b,
    7:r, 8:g, 9:b,
    ...

However, if vertex 5 is the last one in the cycle, its color has to be different from 1, 2 and 3, 4 since it connects to all of them. Therefore we need 4 colors in this case. If vertex 7 is the last one, again we need 4 colors. If vertex 9 is the last one, we need only three colors.

Generally speaking, if k = 3n, we need three colors. Otherwise if k is odd, we need four colors.
