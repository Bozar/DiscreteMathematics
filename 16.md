## 16.3

When there are only two vertices, their degrees are both 0 or 1. Suppose the statement applies to any graph with n-1 vertices, but is not true for a graph with n vertices. This indicates that only 2 of n-1 vertices are of the same degree:

0, 1, 2, ..., k-1, k, k, k+1, ..., n-2
                   A  B

If the new vertex P connects both vertices of the same degree, the resulting graph is contradictory to our assumption.

Next suppose P connects to vertex A, but not vertex B. The degree of P, let's say, p, cannot be n-1, because it cannot connect to vertex B. If p is less than n-1, we can find a vertex Q whose degree is also p. Q comes from two sources. In the original graph, the degree of Q could either be p and remains unchanged in the new graph, or it increases from p-1 to p because it is connnected with P.

## 16.4

Euler's theorem requires that the degree of each vertex to be even. If we add two edges between the same two vertices,

    A -1- B
    A -2- B

When we reach vertex A, we can go forward to B by edge 1 and come back by edge 2 as if nothing happens.

On the other hand,if we add one edge to each side of a vertex:

    -1- A -2-

We will have to add more edges until these new edges form a circuit. Therefore we can start from vertex A, traverse all previous edges by Euler's theorem, then pass the circuit composed of newly added edges.


## 16.5

According to Euler's theorem, if all vertices in a connected graph are of even degree, there exist a Eulerian circuit in the graph, which is an Eulerian walk. If there is just one more edge connecting vertex A and B, we can start from A, traverse edges following Eulerian circuit, then go from A to B, and finishes an Eulerian walk in this way. If there is another edge connecting C and D, in order to cover C-D, we have to go through one or more edges that have been traversed before.

Suppose we have a Eulerian walk,

    v_1 - v_2 - ... - v_n

If v_1 = v_n, this is an Eulerian circuit and every edge has even degree. If v_1 != v_n, every vertice inside the walk must have even degree. Because whenever v_i appears in the walk, we add two unique edges to the vertex. However, both v_1 and v_n have odd degrees because v_1 dose not have a left edge and v_n dose not have a right edge.

### (c)

Let v_i and v_j be two vertices that represent two subsets. If there is an edge between them, v_i must not be equal to v_j, and there can only be one such edge. If we use the edge to represent that there exists a non-empty intersection between two endpoints, any graph can be an intersection graph.

### (d)

A graph that connects vertices of the form {[a_i, b_i]} is not the intersection graph required.

### (b)

When there are only two vertices, Prim's algorithm produces a minimum tree by adding an edge between them. Suppose a tree T created by the algorithm is a minimum tree, but T+e is not, and e is the lowest-weight edge not yet in the tree. We will eventually form a cycle because e is not in the tree. This means that there is another edge e' such that: (1) w(e') >= w(e), because we add e' after e; (2) w(e) >= w(e'), because e is not in the minimum tree. Therefore w(e) = w(e'). We can replace e' with e which dose not change the total weight. This is contradictory to the assumption that e dose not belong to the minimum tree.
