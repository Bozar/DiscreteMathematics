## 6.1

Suppose f^{-1} is not injective, then there exists at least one x that is mapped by two or more y. This is contractory to the fact that f is a function, which means that every x maps to exactly one y.

Suppose f^{-1} is not surjective, then at least one x is not mapped by any y. This is also contractory to the fact that f is a function, which means that every x must map to one y.

Since f^{-1} is both injective and surjective, by definition it is a bijection.

## 6.2

### (a)

Injective. Not surjective, because the image only includes even integers.

f^{-1}(n) = \frac{1}{2}n, where n are even integers.

### (b)

Surjective. Not injective, because f(3) = f(2) = 0.

### (c)

Surjective. Not injective, because f(2, 3) = f(1, 3) = 3

### (d)

Injective. Not surjective, because n/3 are rational numbers, but the codomain is real number.

### (e)

Bijective. f^{-1}(x) = 3x.

### (f)

Bijective. If n is even, let n = 2k, where k is a natural number, therefore f(k) = -k. If n is odd, let n = 2k+1, where k is also a natural number, therefore f(k) = k+1. Combining the two cases above, the image covers every integer. Besides, every integer is mapped by a unique even or odd natural number.

f^{-1}(n) = -2n if n is even and f^{-1}(n) = 2n-1 if n is odd.
