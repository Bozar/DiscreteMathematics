# Chapter 2

## 2.1

The definition says that "An odd integer is any integer that can be written as 2k + 1, where k is also an integer." Since `k` does not need to be a positive integer, we let `k = -2`, and it turns out that -1 is also an odd integer.

* Inverse: If it is not raining, then I do not have my umbrella.
* Converse: If I have my umbrella, then it is raining.
* Contrapositive: If I do not have my umbrella, then it is not raining.

## 2.3

Suppose there are two odd numbers, `2m + 1` and `2n + 1`. The product of them is:

    (2m + 1) * (2n + 1)
    = 4mn + 2m + 2n + 1
    = 2 * (2mn + m + n) + 1

An odd number can be written as `2k + 1`, where `k` is an integer. Because both `m` and `n` are integers, `2mn + m + n` is also an integer. If we let `k = 2mn + m + n`, it shows that the product is an odd number.

## 2.4

First, let's prove a lemma:

> For any integer n, n^2 is divisible by 3 if and only if n is divisible by 3.

If n is divisible by 3, it means that `n = 3m`, where m is an integer. Then `n^2 = (3m)^2 = 3 * (3m^2)`. Since `n^2` has a factor of 3, it is divisible by 3.

Next we shall prove that if n is not divisible by 3, nor is n^2 divisible by 3. Considering the fact that `n = p_{1}^{e_{1}} * p_{2}^{e_{2}} ... p_{n}^{e_{n}}`, in which `p_{i}` is a prime number and `e_{i}` is a positive integer, the statement requires that `p_{i}` cannot be 3. Thus the square of `n` does not contain 3 as a factor either. This means that n^2 cannot be divisible by 3.

Combining the two cases above, we have proved the lemma.

Back to our main topic. Suppose `sqrt{3} = p / q`, where both p and q are integers. If both p and q have one or more factors of 3, we can divide them by 3 continously until at most one of them is divisible by 3. This shows that we can safely assume that in p and q, at most one of them is divisible by 3.

If p is divisible by 3, or in other words, `p = 3k`, where k is an integer, we obtain:

    sqrt{3} * q = p
    3 * q^2 = p^2
    3 * q^2 = 9k^2
    q^2 = 3 * k^2

According to our lemma, if q^2 is divisible by 3, so is q. It is contradictory to our assumption. So `sqrt{3}` does not equal to `p / q`, and therefore it is irrational.

## 2.5

We need to prove the lemma below. The rest proof is similar to exercise 2.4.

> For any integer n, n^3 is even if and only if n is even.

If n is even, which means `n = 2k` where k is an integer, obviously `n^3 = 2 * 4k^3`. Therefore n^3 is also even.

On the other hand, let's suppose `n = p_{1}^{e_{1}} * p_{2}^{e_{2}} ... p_{n}^{e_{n}}`, in which `p_{i}` is a unique prime number and `e_{i}` is a positive integer, then for n^3, `p_{i}^{e_{i}}` can be rewritten as `(p_{i}^{e_{i}})^{3}`. It shows that for every `p_{i}` in n, there must be at least three `p_{i}`s in n^3 and vice versa.

If `n^3 = 2k`, the discussion above proves that there should be at least two more 2s in n^3 and every n has at least one factor of 2, which means n is even.

Thus we have proved the lemma.
