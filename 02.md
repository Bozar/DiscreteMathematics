# Chapter 2

## 2.1

The definition says that "An odd integer is any integer that can be written as 2k + 1, where k is also an integer." Since `k` does not need to be a positive integer, we let `k = -2`, and it turns out that -1 is also an odd integer.

* Inverse: If it is not raining, then I do not have my umbrella.
* Converse: If I have my umbrella, then it is raining.
* Contrapositive: If I do not have my umbrella, then it is not raining.

## 2.3

Suppose there are two odd numbers, `2m + 1` and `2n + 1`. The product of them is:

    (2m + 1) * (2n + 1)
    = 4mn + 2m + 2n + 1
    = 2 * (2mn + m + n) + 1

An odd number can be written as `2k + 1`, where `k` is an integer. Because both `m` and `n` are integers, `2mn + m + n` is also an integer. If we let `k = 2mn + m + n`, it shows that the product is an odd number.

## 2.4

First, let's prove a lemma:

> For any integer n, n^2 is divisible by 3 if and only if n is divisible by 3.

If n is divisible by 3, it means that `n = 3m`, where m is an integer. Then `n^2 = (3m)^2 = 3 * (3m^2)`. Since `n^2` has a factor of 3, it is divisible by 3.

Next we shall prove that if n is not divisible by 3, nor is n^2 divisible by 3. Considering the fact that `n = p_{1}^{e_{1}} * p_{2}^{e_{2}} ... p_{n}^{e_{n}}`, in which `p_{i}` is a prime number and `e_{i}` is a positive integer, the statement requires that `p_{i}` cannot be 3. Thus the square of `n` does not contain 3 as a factor either. This means that n^2 cannot be divisible by 3.

Combining the two cases above, we have proved the lemma.

Back to our main topic. Suppose `sqrt{3} = p / q`, where both p and q are integers. If both p and q have one or more factors of 3, we can divide them by 3 continously until at most one of them is divisible by 3. This shows that we can safely assume that in p and q, at most one of them is divisible by 3.

If p is divisible by 3, or in other words, `p = 3k`, where k is an integer, we obtain:

    sqrt{3} * q = p
    3 * q^2 = p^2
    3 * q^2 = 9k^2
    q^2 = 3 * k^2

According to our lemma, if q^2 is divisible by 3, so is q. It is contradictory to our assumption. So `sqrt{3}` does not equal to `p / q`, and therefore it is irrational.

## 2.5

We need to prove the lemma below. The rest proof is similar to exercise 2.4.

> For any integer n, n^3 is even if and only if n is even.

If n is even, which means `n = 2k` where k is an integer, obviously `n^3 = 2 * 4k^3`. Therefore n^3 is also even.

On the other hand, let's suppose `n = p_{1}^{e_{1}} * p_{2}^{e_{2}} ... p_{n}^{e_{n}}`, in which `p_{i}` is a unique prime number and `e_{i}` is a positive integer, then for n^3, `p_{i}^{e_{i}}` can be rewritten as `(p_{i}^{e_{i}})^{3}`. It shows that for every `p_{i}` in n, there must be at least three `p_{i}`s in n^3 and vice versa.

If `n^3 = 2k`, the discussion above proves that there should be at least two more 2s in n^3 and every n has at least one factor of 2, which means n is even.

Thus we have proved the lemma.

## 2.6

Because `n = p_{1}^{e_{1}} * p_{2}^{e_{2}} ... p_{n}^{e_{n}}`, in which `p_{i}` is a unique prime number and `e_{i}` is a positive integer, if every `e_{i}` is even, then `sqrt{n}` can be expressed as the products of a series of `p_{i}^{(e_{i})/2}`, where `(e_{i})/2` is another integer. Therefore `sqrt{n}` is also an integer.

If, on the other hand, some of the `e_{i}`s are odd, we need to prove that `sqrt{n}` is irrational. Suppose `e_{1}, e_{2}, ... e_{k}` are odd and `k <= n`, we obtain:

    sqrt{n}
        = sqrt{p_{1} * p_{2} ... p_{k}}
        * p_{1}^{(e_{1}-1)/2} * p_{2}^{(e_{2}-1)/2} ... p_{k}^{(e_{k}-1)/2}
        * p_{k+1}^{e_{k+1}/2} * ... p_{n}^{e_{n}/2}

We can prove that `sqrt{n}` is irrational by using two lemmas:

> Lemma 1: sqrt{p_{1} * p_{2} ... p_{k}} is irrational where p_{i} is a unique prime number.
> Lemma 2: If p is rational and q is irrational, then pq is irrational.

For lemma 1, suppose `sqrt{p_{1} * p_{2} ... p_{k}} = m / n`, where both m and n are integers, then `p_{1} * p_{2} ... p_{k} = m^2 / n^2`. Because the left part is the product of a series of prime numbers, the right part must be an integer, which means that `n = 1`. Theorem 1.7 shows that m must contain a factor of `p_{1}`. This results in m^2 must have two `p_{1}` factors, which is contradictory to our restriction that p_{i} is unique. So the square root cannot be represented as the division of two integers and it is irrational.

For lemma 2, if pq is rational, then `pq = m / n`, where m and n are integers, and we have `q = m / (pn)`. It is contradictory to the fact that q is irrational. Therefore pq is irrational.

## 2.7

Unknown.

## 2.8

A square number can be described as n^2, where n is an integer. If it is even, we obtain `n^2 = 2k`, in which k is also an integer. Theorem 1.5 shows that an integer can be expressed as the product of a series of prime numbers. In our case, n^2 has a prime factor of 2. Theorem 1.7 shows that if 2 is an factor of n^2, n must have 2 as a prime factor as well. Therefore, if p is an integer, we have `n^2 = (2p) * (2p) = 4p^2`. The result shows that n^2 is divisible by 4.

## 2.9

(a) Suppose `c = m^2, d = n^2` where m and n are integers. We have `cd = m^2 * n^2 = (mn)^2`. Therefore cd is also a perfect square.

(b) Let `c = 3, d = 12`. Although `cd = 36` is a perfect square, neither c nor d is a perfect square.

(c) Let `x = -2, y = -1`. In this case, `c > d` and `x < y`.

## 2.10

If n is even, let `n = 2k`, where k is an integer, then `17n + 2 = 17 * (2k) + 2 = 2 * (17k + 1)`. The result shows that `17n + 2` is even, which is contracdictory to our assumption that it should be odd.

## 2.11

If `0 > x > y`, the second step is incorrect.

## 2.12

* Original: If p, then q.
* Contrapositive: If not q, then not p.
* The converse of the contrapositive: If not p, then not q.
* Equivalent: If q, then p.

## 2.13

(a) Every positive real number has two square roots p and q such that `p != q`.

(b) For every positive integer, we can find two prime numbers such that `2k = p + q`.

## 2.14

If sqrt{2}^{sqrt{2}} is rational, we have already proved the statement.

On the other hand, let `x = sqrt{2}^{sqrt{2}}`, where x is irrational. We have `x^sqrt{2} = 2`. Considering the fact that 2 is rational, `x and sqrt{2}` are irrational, it matches our statement.

## 2.15

We form a map from 5 people to two status: one either knows X, or does not know X. The Pigeonhole Principle states that at least 2 people know or not know X.

Case 1: Suppose there are exactly 2 people who know(*) X, then the remaining 3 people does not know X.

Case 2: There are 3 or more people who know(*) X.

Considering symmetry, we can replace `know(*)` in the above two cases with `not know` and we shall obtain two more cases. We can conclude from examining all these four cases that there are at least 3 people whom X knows, or at least 3 people whom X does not know.
