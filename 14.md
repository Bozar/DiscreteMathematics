# Chapter 14

## 14.1

False. Since the same vertex cannot appear twice in a path, if u and w are the same vertex, the path from u to w dose not exist.

## 14.2

Suppose there is an arc in TRC but not in RTC. There are three cases.

Case 1. The arc is in the original binary relation. Then it should also appear in RTC, because a closure adds arcs to a relation, rather than remove arcs from it.

Case 2. The arc is x -> x. It must appear in RTC because RTC is reflexive.

Case 3. The arc is x -> z and there also exists two arcs in the original relation: x -> y and y -> z. Therefore x -> z appears in RTC because RTC is transitive.

In conclusion, every arc that exists in TRC also exists in RTC, and vice versa. So TRC and RTC are the same binary relation.

## 14.3

### (a)

Since f is a surjection, every y is mapped by at least one x, therefore f^{-1}(y) cannot be an empty set.

Suppose f(x_1) = y_1, f(x_2) = y_2. If y_1 != y_2, we have x_1 != x_2, because f is a function and every x must map to exactly one y. This shows that the intersection of f^{-1}(y_1) and f^{-1}(y_2) is empty.

Every x must map to one y because f is a function. So the union of f^{-1}(y) includes all x.

In conclusion, f^{-1}(y) is a partition of S.

### (b)

If f is just a function instead of a surjection, some y are not mapped by any x. Therefore f^{-1}(y) is an empty set and it cannot be a block of the partition.

### (c)

If f is a bijection, every x maps to a different y and vice versa. So the blocks are every single element in S: {x_1}, {x_2}, ... {x_n}.

### (d)

In Example 14.1, x refers to one person and y refers to a hometown, f^{-1}(y) refers to people belong to one hometown. Each group of people is a block in the partition of the set of all people.

### (e)

Every block includes real numbers from n (inclusive) to n+1 (exclusive), starting from n=0.

## 14.4

### (a)

<{x}, {x -> x}>

### (b)

<{x, y, z}, {x -> y, y -> z, x -> z, x -> x, y -> y, z -> z}>

### (c)

<{x, y}, {x -> y, y -> x, x -> x, y -> y}>

### (d)

<{x, y, z}, {x -> y, y -> z, x -> z, y -> x, z -> y, z -> x}>

## 14.5

It is not transitive. Because there is only one arc x -> y, and y -> z does not exist.

It is not reflexive. Because x -> x does not hold.

It is not symmetric. Because y -> z does not hold.

## 14.6

### (a)

Only cdab overlaps {a, b}.

### (b)

Overlap is not reflexive. abc overlaps c, but c does not overlap abc.

### (c)

Overlap is symmetric. The same string s can be represented in two ways: `<\lambda, s>` and `<s, \lambda>`. It turns out that s overlaps s itself.

### (d)

Overlap is transitive. If u -> v and v -> w, let u = `<s, <v_1, v_2>>`, v = `<v_1, v_2>`, and w = `<v_2, \lambda>`. It turns out that u -> w also holds.

## 14.7

### (a)

Transitive. Reflexive. Antisymmetric.

### (b)

Transitive. Neither reflexive nor symmetric.

### (c)

None of the properties holds.

### (d)

All properties hold.

### (e)

Transitive. Reflexive. Antisymmetric.

### (f)

Not transitive. Reflexive. Symmetric.
