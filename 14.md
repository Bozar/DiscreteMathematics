False. Since the same vertex cannot appear twice in a path, if u and w are the same vertex, the path from u to w dose not exist.

## 14.2

Suppose there is an arc in TRC but not in RTC. There are three cases.

Case 1. The arc is in the original binary relation. Then it should also appear in RTC, because a closure adds arcs to a relation, rather than remove arcs from it.

Case 2. The arc is x -> x. It must appear in RTC because RTC is reflexive.

Case 3. The arc is x -> z and there also exists two arcs in the original relation: x -> y and y -> z. Therefore x -> z appears in RTC because RTC is transitive.

In conclusion, every arc that exists in TRC also exists in RTC, and vice versa. So TRC and RTC are the same binary relation.
