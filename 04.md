# Chapter 4

## 4.1

Base case. a_1, a_2 and a_3 are divisible by 3.

Induction hypothesis. Suppose for 1 <= m <= n, where n > 3, a_m is divisible by 3.

Induction step. a_{n+1} = a_n + a_{n-2}. Since n and n-2 are equal to or less than n, according to our hypothesis, a_n and a_{n-2} are divisible by 3. Therefore a_{n+1} is also divisible by 3.

## 4.2

Base case. n = 8, a = 1, b = 1. n = 9, a = 3, b = 0.

Induction hypothesis. Suppose for 8 <= m <= n, where n > 9, m = 3a + 5b.

Induction step. n + 1 = 3a + 5b + 1 = 3(a-1) + 5(b-1) + 9 = 3(a+2) + 5(b-1).

## 4.3

Base case. When n = 2, we can fill the 4*4 square in a least two ways:

    A A E . | . D A A
    A D E E | D D E A
    B D D C | C E E B
    B B C C | C C B B

Induction hypothesis. Suppose for a fixed n >= 2, we can fill a 2^n*2^n square as required.

Induction step. A 2^{n+1}*2^{n+1} square is four times bigger than its 2^n counterpart. We can combine four small parts and fill the center with an L-shaped tile.

    A A B B
    A . B B
    D . . C
    D D C C

## 4.4

Base case. n = 0, the result is 1. n = 1, the result is 1+\frac{1}{x}. Both of them are integers.

Induction hypothesis. Suppose for 0 <= m <= n, where n > 1, x^m + \frac{1}{x^m} is an integer.

Induction step.

    (x+\frac{1}{x}) * (x^n+\frac{1}{x^n})
    = (x^{n+1}+\frac{1}{x^{n+1}}) + (x^{n-1}+\frac{1}{x^{n-1}})

According to our hypothesis, p, q and r are integers:

    p = x+\frac{1}{x}
    q = x^n+\frac{1}{x^n}
    r = x^{n-1}+\frac{1}{x^{n-1}}

Therefore x^{n+1}+\frac{1}{x^{n+1}} = p*q-r is also an integer.

## 4.5

Base case. When n = 1, 2 and 3, a_n < 2^n.

Induction hypothesis. Suppose for 1<= m <= n, n > 3, a_m < 2^m.

Induction step.

    a_n * 2 = a_n + a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + a_{n-3}     (1)
    a_n + a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} < (1) < 2^{n+1}         // a_n < 2^n

    a_{n+1} = a_n + a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} < 2^{n+1}

## 4.6

First we use P(0) as the base case to prove that P(1) is true. Then use P(1) as the new base case to verify P(2). Repeat this process until we have proved all k cases that are required by strong induction are true.

Next we suppose that P(n) is true for n >= k. Our last step is to prove that P(n+1) is true.

## 4.7

Base case. If k = 1, then n has only one prime factor p_1. On the right side, l must be equal to k and r_1 = p_1. If e_1 != f_1, we can deduce that p^g = 1, where g is a non-zero integer. This cannot be true, so e_1 must be equal to f_1.

Induction hypothesis. Suppose for m >= 1, k = l, p_m = r_m for each i, and e_m = f_m for each i.

Induction step. Let n' = p_m * p_{m+1}^{e_{m+1}} = r_m * r_{m+1}^{f_{m+1}}. Since p_m = r_m = n, we have p_{m+1}^{e_{m+1}} = r_{m+1}^{f_{m+1}}. This is the same situation as our base case, therefore p_{m+1} = r_{m+1} and e_{m+1} = f_{m+1}.

## 4.8

### (a)

Base case. If such a set has only one element, then the integer in the set must be the smallest element.

Induction hypothesis. Suppose for a set of size k, where k >= 1, we can always find a smallest elemnt p.

Induction step. Now we add another element q to the set above. q cannot be equal to p, because elements in a set must be unqiut. If q > p, then p is still the smallest element. Otherwise if q < p, q become the new smallest element in the set.

### (b)

Suppose we have a set of non-negative integers to verify if P(n_i) is true. If we remove n_0 from this set, the Well-Ordering Principle states that there is always another smallest integer n_k. Start from P(n_0) is true, we can prove step by step that P(n_0+1), P(n_0+2), ..., P(n_0+m) is true, until we reach the point that n_0 + m = n_k. Then we remove n_k from the set and check the next smallest integer following the same procedure until we verify that P(n_i) is true for every integer n_i in such a set.

## 4.9

S = {2, 5}. Let p = 2, then q = 100/2 = 50 = 2*5^2. Therefore 100 = 2^2 * 5^2.

## 4.10

In order to pay as many stamps as possible, we shall purchase 2-cent stamps first. If n = 2k, we can buy k 2-cent stamsp. If n = 2k+1, we can once again purchase k 2-cent stamps with 1 cent remaining.
