# Chapter 3

## 3.1

First, we observe that:

* When n = 1, the output is 1. This is the base case.
* When n = 2, the output is 4.
* When n = 3, the output is 9.

Induction hypothesis. Suppose `\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(2i+1) = n^2`.

Induction step. For `n + 1`, we need to prove that `\sum_{i=0}^{n}(2i+1) = (n+1)^2`.

    \sum_{i=0}^{n}
        = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} + (2n+1)
        = n^2 + (2n+1)
        = (n+1)^2

## 3.2

First, let's restate the principle based on count(Y). For every n >= 1, it is true that

    For any finite sets X and Y such that count(X) > count(Y) and count(Y) = n, if f is a map from X to Y, then there are distinct elements x_1, x_2 in X, y in Y,  such that f(x_1) = f(x_2) = y.

Base case. n = 1. If count(X) > count(Y), we suppose count(X) = 2. Since there is a function from X to Y, both elements in X must be mapped to the only element in Y.

Induction hypothesis. Suppose for some n >= 1, count(X) > count(Y), count(Y) = n, and f is a function from X to Y, there are two distinct elements in X, and another element in Y, such that f(x_1) = f(x_2) = y.

Induction step. We need to prove that if count(Y) = n+1, there are two distinct elements in X, and another element in Y, such that f(x_1) = f(x_2) = y.

Case 1. For an element y in Y, if it is mapped by two distinct elements in X, the induction is proved.

Case 2. If such y is mapped by only one element in X, we take it away from Y. Now count(Y) = n and count(X) > count(Y). This is exactly our hypothesis.

## 3.3

The Extended Pigeon Hole Principle states that if count(X) > k*count(Y), and there is a map f from X to Y, it is true that there are at least k+1 elements in X, such that f(x_1) = f(x_2) = ... = f(x_{k+1})

Base case. When k=1, we can use the Pigeon Hole Principle to prove this situation.

Induction hypothesis. Suppose for a certain k>1, if count(X) > k*count(Y), and there is a map f from X to Y, it is true that there are at least k+1 elements in X, such that f(x_1) = f(x_2) = ... = f(x_{k+1})

Induction step. We need to prove that if count(X) > (k+1) * count(Y), there are at least k+2 elements in X, and all of them are mapped to the same element in Y.
Note that count(X) + count(Y) > (k+1) * count(Y). It means that we add count(Y) distinct elements to the existing X set.

Case 1. There are at least one newly added element x, which satisfies that f(x_1) = f(x). By adding this element to our existing k+1 elements, we have k+2 elements in X that are mapped to the same element in Y.

Case 2. None of the newly added elements is mapped to the same element in Y as x_1. Now let's create two new sets, X' and Y'. For X', first we remove k+1 elements (x_1, x_2, ... , x_{k+1}) from X. Then we add count(Y) new elements. Therefore, count(X') = count(X) - (k+1) + count(Y). For Y, we remove the element y that is mapped by k+1 elements in X. So count(Y') = count(Y)-1.

    count(X') - count(Y')
    = (count(X) - (k+1) + count(Y)) - (count(Y)-1)
    = count(X)-k
    > k*count(Y)-k      // According to our hypothesis, count(X) > k*count(Y).
    = k*(count(Y)-1)
    = k*count(Y')       // By definition, count(Y') = count(Y)-1

This shows that count(X') > (k+1) * count(Y'). According to our hypothesis, there are at least k+2 elements in X' which are all mapped to the same element in Y'.

## 3.4

### (a)

\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(2^{2i+1})

Base case. When n=1, 2/3 * (4^1-1) = 2.

Induction hypothesis. Suppose for an integer k>1,

    \sum_{i=0}^{k-1}(2^{2i+1}) = 2/3 * (4^k-1)

Induction step. We need to prove that,

    \sum_{i=0}^{k}(2^{2i+1}) = 2/3 * (4^(k+1)-1)

Proof.

    \sum_{i=0}^{k}(2^{2i+1})
    = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1}(2^{2i+1}) + 2^{2k+1}
    = 2/3 * (4^k-1) + 2^{2k+1}
    = 2/3 * (4^k-1) + 2*4^k
    = 2/3 * (4^k-1 + 3*4^k)
    = 2/3 * (4^(k+1)-1)

### (b)

    \prod_{i=1}^{n}(2^{-i})
    = 2^{-(1+2+3+...+n)}
    = 2^{-(n*(n+1))/2}

## 3.5

Base case. When n=0, \sum_{i=0}^{n}(i^2) = 0.

Induction hypothesis. Suppose for k>0,

    \sum_{i=0}^{k}(i^2) = \frac{k*(k+1)*(2k+1)}{6}

Induction step. We need to prove that,

    \sum_{i=0}^{k+1}(i^2) = \frac{(k+1)*(k+2)*(2k+3)}{6}

Proof.

    \sum_{i=0}^{k+1}(i^2)
    = \sum_{i=0}^{k}(i^2) + (k+1)^2
    = \frac{k * (k+1) * (2k+1)}{6} + (k+1)^2
    = \frac{k * (k+1) * (2k+1) + 6*(k+1)^2}{6}
    = \frac{(k+1) * (k*(2k+1) + 6(k+1))}{6}
    = \frac{(k+1) * (2k^2+7k+6)}{6}
    = \frac{(k+1) * (k+2) * (2k+3)}{6}

## 3.6

### (a)

S(0) = 1
S(1) = 1 + 2^{-1} = 3/2
S(2) = 3/2 + 2^{-2} = 7/4
S(3) = 7/4 + 2^{-3} = 15/8

### (b) & (c)

We need to prove that S(n) = 2 - 2^{-n}.

Base case. S(0) = 1.

Induction hypothesis.  Suppose for k > 0, S(k) = 2 - 2^{-k}.

Induction step. We need to prove that S(k+1) = 2 - 2^{-(k+1)}.

    S(k+1)
    = S(k) + 2^{-(k+1)}
    = (2 - 2^{-k}) + 2^{-(k+1)}
    = (2 - 2^{-k}) + (1/2 * 2^{-k})
    = 2 - 1/2 * 2^{-k}
    = 2 - 2^{-(k+1)}

### (d)

Suppose S(n) is the largest possible value that is less than 2, then S(n+1) should be equal to or greater than 2. In other words, S(n+1) >= 2. Therefore,

    2 - \frac{1}{2^{n+1}} >= 2
    -\frac{1}{2^{n+1}} >= 0

However, because \frac{1}{2^{n+1}} is always positive, S(n+1) cannot be equal to or greater than 2. It means that for any integer n, we can always find another integer n', which satisfies that n' > n and S(n') < 2.

## 3.7

Base case. When n = 0, both sides equal to 0.

Induction hypothesis. Suppse for k > 0,

    \sum_{i=0}^{k}(i^3) = (\sum_{i=0}^{k}(i))^2

Induction step. We need to prove that

    \sum_{i=0}^{k+1}(i^3) = (\sum_{i=0}^{k+1}(i))^2

Let s = \sum_{i=0}^{k}(i) = \frac{k*(k+1)}{2}.

First consider the left side.

    \sum_{i=0}^{k+1}(i^3)
    = \sum_{i=0}^{k}(i^3) + (k+1)^3
    = s^2 + (k+1)^3

Next the right side.

    (\sum_{i=0}^{k+1}(i))^2
    = (\sum_{i=0}{k}(i) + (k+1))^2
    = (s + (k+1))^2
    = s^2 + (k+1)*(2s+(k+1))
    = s^2 + (k+1)*(k*(k+1)+(k+1))       // Replace s with k.
    = s^2 + (k+1)^3

This shows that the left side equals to the right side.

## 3.8

### (a)

Base case. When n = 1, the equation is true.

Induction hypothesis. Suppose for k > 1,

    \sum_{i=1}^{k}(2^{i-1}*i) = 2^k*(k-1)+1

Induction step. We need to prove that

    \sum_{i=1}^{k+1}(2^{i-1}*i) = 2^(k+1)*k+1

Proof.

    \sum_{i=1}^{k+1}(2^{i-1}*i)
    = \sum_{i=1}^{k}(2^{i-1}*i) + 2^k*(k+1)
    = (2^k*(k-1)+1) + 2^k*(k+1)
    = 2^k*2k + 1
    = 2^(k+1) + 1

### (b)

Base case. If n = 1, both sides equal to 1.

Induction hypothesis. Suppose for k > 1,

    \sum_{i=1}^{k}(2^{k-1}) = 2^k*(k^2-2k+3)-3

Induction step. We need to prove that

    \sum_{i=1}^{k+1}(2^{k}) = 2^{k+1}*(k^2+2)-3

Proof.

    \sum_{i=1}^{k+1}(2^{k})
    = \sum_{i=1}^{k}{2^{k-1}*k^2} + 2^k*(k+1)^2
    = 2^k*(k^2-2k+3) - 3 + 2^k*(k+1)^2
    = 2^k*(k^2-2k+3+k^2+2k+1) - 3
    = 2^{k+1}(k^2+2) - 3

## 3.9

We should consider the base case in which there are 2 horses in a set, rather than 1. If we start from a set of size 1, we cannot create two different subsets A and B from 2 horses. On the other hand, for the base case with 2 horses, we cannot prove that these horses are of the same color. Therefore the statement is false.

## 3.10

Consider the fact that

    n_1 = 1
    n_{i+1} = n_i + i

Therefore n_10 = n_9 + 9. Even if we increase by 9 for every number after n_1, n_10 will be 1+9*9 = 82, which is less than 512. So 512 cannot be the last number.

## 3.11

### (a)

If n = 1, T_2 = 0110 is palindrome. Suppose T_2n = L-R. L and R are two strings of length n and they are symmetry to the center. According to the definion of the Thue sequence, the complement of L is R and vice versa. Therefore T_{2n+1} = LR-RL, T_{2n+2} = LRRL-RLLR. Since every segment on the left side has a symmetrical image on the right, T_{2n+2} has the same structure as T_2n, so it is also palindrome.

### (b)

Base case. If n = 0, T_1 can be generated in this way: 0 -> 01.

Induction hypothesis. Suppose for n >= 0, this operation converts T_n to T_n-U_n, where U_n is T_n's complement.

Induction step. We need to prove that by appling the same operation to T_{n+1}, we shall get T_{n+2}. Since T_{n+1} = T_n-U_n, after convert every segment of T_{n+1}, we have (T_n-U_n)-(U_n-T_n). It has the same component as T_{n+2}.

## 3.12

If we can prove a statement strat from the base case P(0), we can increase the index inside P until it reaches n_0, which is the base index required by Mathetical Induction.
