## 16.3

When there are only two vertices, their degrees are both 0 or 1. Suppose the statement applies to any graph with n-1 vertices, but is not true for a graph with n vertices. This indicates that only 2 of n-1 vertices are of the same degree:

0, 1, 2, ..., k-1, k, k, k+1, ..., n-2
              C    A  B

If the new vertex P connects both vertices of the same degree, the resulting graph is contradictory to our assumption.

Next suppose P connects to vertex A, but not vertex B. The degree of P, let's say, p, cannot be n-1, because it cannot connect to vertex B. If p is less than n-2, we can find a vertex Q whose degree is also p. Q is next to the vertex in the original graph which is connected to P and has the maximum degree. If the degree of the new vertex is n-1, therefore vertex C and B have the same degree k. Both cases are contradictory to our assumption that none of the two vertices are of the same degree.
