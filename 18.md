# Chapter 18

## 18.1

The graph has a 3-colorable.

    1:r, 3:g, 5:r, 4:g, 2:b
    6:g, 8:b, 7:g

We can replace any vertex with a fourth color.

2-5-4 is an odd length cycle, so 2-coloring cannot exist.

## 18.2

The chromatic number is n-1. In a complete graph, every vertex must have a different color from all other vertices. Suppose an edge connects two vertices, red and green. By removing the edge, we can re-color the green vertex with red, and the original red vertex remains unchanged. This shows that we need n-1 colors for a K_n - e graph.

## 18.3

The chromatic number is 2. Add up every vertex's i and j. If the sum is even, color the vertex with white, otherwise color it with black. Every vertex is adjacent to at most four neighbors. There are four combinations of i and j and they belong to two groups:

Group 1: i = 2m, j = 2n; or i = 2m+1, j = 2n+1.

The sum of i+j is even, and the combination of i and j for all its neighbors belong to the second group.

Group 2: i = 2m+1, j = 2n; or i = 2m, j = 2n+1.

The sum of i+j is odd, and the combination of i and j for all its neighbors belong to the first group.

Therefore there only exists two types of vertices in the graph.

## 18.4

### (a)

Let n=2k. We can draw an isomorphic graph of two nested polygons. Each polygon has k vertices. Label the outer polgon with odd numbers, and the inner with even numbers. Connect these two polygons to form a cycle: 1-2-3-... . No edges are crossed in this graph. According to the Four-Color Theorem, such a planar graph is 4-colorable.

### (b)

If there are infinite vertices, we can color each of them with one of three colors:

    1:r, 2:g, 3:b,
    4:r, 5:g, 6:b,
    7:r, 8:g, 9:b,
    ...

However, if vertex 5 is the last one in the cycle, its color has to be different from 1, 2 and 3, 4 since it connects to all of them. Therefore we need 4 colors in this case. If vertex 7 is the last one, again we need 4 colors. If vertex 9 is the last one, we need only three colors.

Generally speaking, if k = 3n, we need three colors. Otherwise if k is odd, we need four colors.

## 18.5

Three rooms are needed.

* Room 1: Andre, Chloe.
* Room 2: Bridget, Eloise, Fabio.
* Room 3: Daniel.

## 18.6

Input a, b, c into r_1, r_2 and r_3. We need one additional register, r_4.

* r_2 <- r_1 - r_2
* r_2 <- r_2 * r_2
* r_4 <- r_1 - r_3
* r_3 <- r_1 + 1
* r_3 <- r_3 * r_3
* r_1 <- r_1 * r_2
* r_1 <- r_1 * r_4
* r_2 <- r_1 / r_3

Output r_2.

## 18.7

Four computers are needed.

* Computer 1: Amal, Bianca.
* Computer 2: Chung, Diego.
* Computer 3: Elijah.
* Computer 4: Frances.

## 18.8

Unknown.

## 18.9

At least 5 weekly meetings are required.

* Meeting 1: Athletics.
* Meeting 2: Budget.
* Meeting 3: Compensation.
* Meeting 4: Diversity, Education.
* Meeting 5: Football.

## 18.10

In such a graph, vertices of different colors refer to courses that share no students. These classes can be held simutaneously. The chromatic number is the total number of classes.

## 18.11

We can draw a planar graph from a map by merging multiple edges between the same two vertices into one. If there are two crossing edges, it means in the original map there are four different areas in the same position, which is impossible. Therefore, for every map, there exists a corresponding planar graph.

We can also draw a dual of a planar graph. The dual divides the plane into different regions, each of which contains one vertex.

The above discussions show that there is a one-to-one map between map regions and planar graph vertices. So a map is 4-colorable if and only if a planar graph is 4-colorable.
