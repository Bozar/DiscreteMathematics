# Chapter 15

## 15.1

<3549, 462> -> <462, 315> -> <315, 147> -> <147, 21> -> <21, 0>.

## 15.2

Let P = {0, 1, 2, ..., 7}

V = P x P

\sigma = {a1, a2, b1, b2}

A = union(
    {<m, 0> -a1-> <0, m-1>},
    {<m, 0> -a2-> <0, m-2>},
    {<0, m> -b1-> <m-1, 0>},
    {<0, m> -b2-> <m-2, 0>}
), where both m and n belongs to P.

Winning states for the first player:

<2, 0>, <3, 0>, <5, 0>, <6, 0>, <0, 1>, <0, 4>, <0, 7>.

## 15.3

V = <i, o>, where i belongs to {0, 1, 2, 3} and o belongs to {0, 1}.

\sigma = {+1, -1}

A = union(
    {<i, o> - +1 -> <i+1, o>, if i+1 < 4},
    {<i, o> - +1 -> <0, 1>, if i+1 > 3},
    {<i, o> - -1 -> <i-1, o>, if i-1 > -1},
    {<i, o> - -1 -> <3, 1>, if i-1 < 0}
)

## 15.4

Note that d_i refers to the number of tiles that match both criteria:

* Position: They are behind tile i.
* Label: The label j is less than i.

### (a)

When the empty space moves horizontally, the row number r does not change. The relative position and label order of the tiles on row r also remain the same. Therefore D dose not change.

### (b)

    | d_? | d_i | d_j | d_k |
    | d_l |     | d_? | d_? |

When the empty space moves up one row, r decreases by 1.

Consider tiles behind d_i and before the empty space. Suppose there are m tiles whose labels are less than i, and there are n tiles whose labels are greater than i. After the movement, D changes by n-m-1.

Since m+n = 3, we have:

    m  n  n-m  n-m-1
    0  3  3    -1
    1  2  1    0
    2  1  -1   -2
    3  0  -3   -4

All changes are even numbers. Similarly, when the empty space moves down one row, D also changes by an even number.

### (c)

In the start state, D is 0. The state space contains only two labels: move the empty space horizontally or vertically. We have already proved that the first type of movement does not change D, and the second type results in a new D which is also an even number. Therefore D is always even.

### (d)

Suppose this state is reachable. According to the Invariant Principle, D should be even. However, D is 1 in this case. So the state cannot be reached from the given initial state.
