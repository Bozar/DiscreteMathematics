# Chapter 6

## 6.1

Suppose f^{-1} is not injective, then there exists at least one x that is mapped by two or more y. This is contractory to the fact that f is a function, which means that every x maps to exactly one y.

Suppose f^{-1} is not surjective, then at least one x is not mapped by any y. This is also contractory to the fact that f is a function, which means that every x must map to one y.

Since f^{-1} is both injective and surjective, by definition it is a bijection.

## 6.2

### (a)

Injective. Not surjective, because the image only includes even integers.

f^{-1}(n) = \frac{1}{2}n, where n are even integers.

### (b)

Surjective. Not injective, because f(3) = f(2) = 0.

### (c)

Surjective. Not injective, because f(2, 3) = f(1, 3) = 3

### (d)

Injective. Not surjective, because n/3 are rational numbers, but the codomain is real number.

### (e)

Bijective. f^{-1}(x) = 3x.

### (f)

Bijective. If n is even, let n = 2k, where k is a natural number, therefore f(k) = -k. If n is odd, let n = 2k+1, where k is also a natural number, therefore f(k) = k+1. Combining the two cases above, the image covers every integer. Besides, every integer is mapped by a unique even or odd natural number.

f^{-1}(n) = -2n if n is even and f^{-1}(n) = 2n-1 if n is odd.

## 6.3

### (a)

Suppose size(A) = m, size(B) = n. Since r is an injective function from A to B, there are at least m distinct elements in B that is mapped by elements in A. In other words, n >= m. If r is not surjective, it means there is at least one element in B that is not mapped by elements in A, therefore n >= m+1. This is contrary to the fact that siza(A) = size(B). So r must be surjective.

### (b)

Let A = {k^2: k is an integer}, B = {k+1: k is an integer}. Obviously there exists two bijective relations from the set of the set of integers to A and B. The square root of an element in A maps to an element in B, so the relation from A to B is injective. However, set B contains non-perfect squares that do not exist in A. This shows that the map from A to B is not surjective.

## 6.4

{<y, x>: x^2 + y^2 = 1}

## 6.5

In order to form a map f^{-1} from a sub set of B to A, f must be injective. In order to map elements in A to elements in C, A must be equal to D, and g is bijective. We can express the composition as g^{-1}(f^{-1(B')}), where B' is a sub set of B.

## 6.6

Form 3 blocks from 24 available hours. Each block contains 7 continous hours. Since there are only 15 people and all 3 blocks have 21 hours, we can guarantee that the remaining 3 hours are not occupied. Now there are two sets: set A has 15 people, set B has 3 blocks. Since size(A) > size(b)*4, at least 5 people appear in the same block. In other words, there are 5 people using computer during 7 hours.

## 6.7

    f^{-1}(n) = \frac{1}{2}n
    g^{-1}(n) = \frac{n-1}{2}.

    h(n)
    = g^{-1}(f^{-1}(n))
    = g^{-1}(\frac{1}{2}n)
    = \frac{\frac{1}{2}n - 1}{2}
    = \frac{n-2}{4}
