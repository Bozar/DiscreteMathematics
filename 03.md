First, we observe that:

* When n = 1, the output is 1. This is the base case.
* When n = 2, the output is 4.
* When n = 3, the output is 9.

Induction hypothesis. Suppose `\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(2i+1) = n^2`.

Induction step. For `n + 1`, we need to prove that `\sum_{i=0}^{n}(2i+1) = (n+1)^2`.

    \sum_{i=0}^{n}
        = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} + (2n+1)
        = n^2 + (2n+1)
        = (n+1)^2

## 3.2

First, let's restate the principle based on count(Y). For every n >= 1, it is true that

    For any finit sets X and Y such that count(X) > count(Y) and count(Y) = n, if f is a map from X to Y, then there are distinct elements x_1, x_2 in X, y in Y,  such that f(x_1) = f(x_2) = y.

Base case. n = 1. If count(X) > count(Y), we suppose count(X) = 2. Since there is a function from X to Y, both elements in X must be mapped to the only element in Y.

Induction hypothesis. Suppose for some n >= 1, count(X) > count(Y), count(Y) = n, and f is a function from X to Y, there are two discinct elements in X, and another element in Y, such that f(x_1) = f(x_2) = y.

Induction step. We need to prove that if count(Y) = n+1, there are two distinct elements in X, and another element in Y, such that f(x_1) = f(x_2) = y.

Case 1. For an element y in Y, if it is mapped by two distinct elements in X, the induction is proved.

Case 2. If such y is mapped by only one element in X, we take it away from Y. Now count(Y) = n and count(X) > count(Y). This is exactly our hypothesis.
