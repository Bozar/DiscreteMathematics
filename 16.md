## 16.3

When there are only two vertices, their degrees are both 0 or 1. Suppose the statement applies to any graph with n-1 vertices, but is not true for a graph with n vertices. This indicates that only 2 of n-1 vertices are of the same degree:

0, 1, 2, ..., k-1, k, k, k+1, ..., n-2
              C    A  B

If the new vertex N connects both vertices of the same degree, the resulting graph is contradictory to our assumption.

Next suppose N connects to vertex A, but not vertex B. The degree of N cannot be n-1, because it cannot connect to vertex B. If the degree of N is less than n-2, we can find a vertex X whose degree is also p. X has two potential sources. It either comes from the vertex of degree p in the original graph, or comes from connecting the new vertex with the vertex of degree p-1. If the degree of the new vertex is n-1, therefore vertex C and B have the same degree k. Both case are contradictory to our assumption that none of the two vertices are of the same degree.
