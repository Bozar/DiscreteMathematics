# Chapter 17

## 17.1

The edge connectivity is n-2. The vertex connectivity is n-1.

## 17.2

Two edge-disjoint paths might start from and end with the same vertices.

If there are two paths that share no vertex along the way, it turns out that v_i-v_{i+1} from the first path can never appear in the second path. In other words, these two paths are also edge-disjoint.

## 17.3

A minimum-size <s, t>-edge-cut includes four edges that are connected directly to vertex s.

## 17.4

When a complete graph has two vertices, both the edge connectivity and vertex connectivity are 1. Suppose the statement holds true for any graph with n-1 vertices. We only need to consider edges that start from the Nth vertex p, because the hypothesis guarantees that no matter how n-1 vertices are connected, the statement always is true.

If p is not connected to any vertex, both the edge connectivity and vertex connectivity are 0. Whenever we add a new edge between p and an existing vertex, both the edge connectivity and vertex connectivity increase by 1. However, they cannot be greater than e and v, where e and v are the edge connectivity and vertex connectivity of the graph with n-1 vertices. According to the hypothesis, we have e <= v. This shows that the statement is true for all graphs.

## 17.5

If the new vertex v is connected to p vertices, and p < k, therefore the new graph is p-connected.

In the original graph, let S = {q}, T = V-S, where V is the set of all vertices, q is the vertex whose vertex connectivity is k. Next we add the new vertex p to set S. Since p is connected to at least k vertices, according to Menger's theorem, the minimum size of an <S, T>-vertex-cut remains to be k. In other words, the graph is still k-connected.

## 17.6

Connected: n-1 edges. One vertex sits in the center that connects to all other vertices.

Biconnected: n edges. A cycle.

(n-1)-connected: \frac{n(n-1)}{2} edges. A complete graph.

## 17.7

In a biconnected graph, every vertex must connect to at least two distinct vertices.

    ... - v_0 - v_1 - v_2 - ...

Since a graph has finite vertices, eventually v_0 will appear on the right side of a vertex. This shows that there is a cycle which includes all vertices in the graph.

## 17.8

If there is only one vertex, the maximum number is 0. If there are two vertices, the number is 1. If n > 2, the number is \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}. We can form a complete graph with n-1 vertices, and the Nth vertex is not connected to any other vertices.

## 17.9

### (a)

In W_4, every vertex on the cycle is connected to all other vertices in the graph. Therefore, W_4 = K_4. In any wheel graph, the center could be turned into one vertex on the cycle. In W_4, since it is a complete graph, any vertex on the cycle can also be turned into the center. Therefore, any vertices could be chosen as the hub.

The wheel structure requires that any vertex on the cycle is connected to exactly three vertices: its left and right neighbor, and wheel center. When n>4, if a vertex on the cycle can also be the center, it must be connected to all other vertices, the number of which is greater than 3. This is contradictory to our assumption.

### (b)

Pick any vertex on the cycle. There are three vertex disjoint paths to any other vertices: through its left or right neighbor, or through center.

The center can also reach any vertex by three vertex disjoint paths: reach the vertex directly, or through its left and right neighbor.

In conclusion, W_n has vertex connectivity 3.

## 17.10

If every pair of vertices <s, t> is connected by at least k vertex-disjoint paths, according to Menger's theorem, the vertex connectivity of s is at least k. The minimum connectivity is k, so the graph is k-connected.

When the graph is 0-connected, there are no paths connecting any vertices. Suppose the statement is ture for any (k-1)-connected graphs. If we add a new path between vertices s and t which shares one or more edges with existing paths, the vertex connectivity does not increase. To make the graph k-connected, between every pair of vertices, there must be at least one more vertex-disjoint path. This results in that there are k vertex-disjoint paths between any pair of vertices.
