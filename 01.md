# Chapter 1

## 1.2

Let `x = p_1 * p_2 ... p_n` and `y = x * p_(n-1)`. It satisifies `x < y` and `f(x) > f(y)`.

For example, `x = 2 * 3 = 6` and `y = 2 * 3 * 2 = 12`.

## 1.3

If x is an integer, `floor(x) == ceil(x)`.

Otherwise, suppose `x = m + p/q`, in which x, m, p and q are integers and `p < q`. We have `floor(x) = m` and `ceil(x) = m + 1`, which meets the requirement.

## 1.4

Let's consider two 1-dimension rows A & B: `A: [1, 2], B: [1, 2, 3]`. Obviously in row B, we cannot guarantee that after the movement, all holes have at most one pigeon.

* We define a neighbor as a list which contains two adjacent grids. For example, `[1, 2]` and `[2, 3]` are neighbors in row B.
* If we join k neighbors (which form set N) into one row and add a single grid at the end, we will get a row which has `2k + 1` grids. We fill all these grids with pigeons and they form set P.
* We define a map from P to N following these rules:
    * A pigeon must move one step.
    * If its current position is included in a neighbor, it moves into the other grid defined by the neighbor.
    * Otherwise, it moves into a grid in a neighbor which has the minimum value.
* Since `2k + 1 > k * 2`, The Extended Pigeonhole Principle states that there are at least 3 pigeons moving into the same neighbor, which has only 2 grids. This ends up two pigeons in one hole.

A 2-dimension square has `(2k + 1)^2` grids. Each row has k neighbors, and there are `2k + 1` rows in all. (Note that neighbors should not overlap with each other.) For the last column, we pack neighbors vertically and there are k of them. So we have `k * (2k + 1) + k = 2k^2 + 2k` neighbors in all. Since `size(P) = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1` and `size(N) = 2k^2 + 2k`, we can conclude that `size(P) > size(N) * 2`. As we have discussed above, this shows that there will be two pigeons in one hole.

## 1.5

The problem implies that we need two sets. Set P includes every people in a group and set N lists all the number of friends. A map from P to N links a person to his or her number of friends. Now we need to prove that set P has more elements than N.

Since one cannot be a friend of himself, the maximum possible integer in N is `p - 1`. We use p to refer the size of P. In this case, the minimum possible element of N is 1. Because friendship is symmertrical. If Tom is everyone's friend, then everyone except Tom has at least 1 friend. So the size of N is `p - 1`.

If the maximum number in N is `p - k`, where k is an integer greater than 1, then the minimum number is 0. The size of N is `p - k + 1`. Because `p - 1 >= p - k + 1` when `k >= 2`, `p - 1` is the maximum possible size of N.

The Pigeonhole Principle stats that for such a map from P to N, in which P has `p` elements and N has at most `p - 1` elements, there are at least 2 `p`s mapped to the same `n`, which means two people have the same number of friends.

## 1.6

We select two points and draw a crossing line that separates the sphere into two parts. If none of the remaining points lie on the equator, then we need to put three points into two open hemisphere. One of the hemisphere must contain at least two points. This open hemisphere along with the equator satisfies the requirement. If the equator passes through three or more points, the conclusion remains unchanged.

## 1.7

Let set P contains 25 people and set B contains 12 months. Since `25 > 12 * 2`, at least 3 people are born on the same month.

## 1.8

Let set C contains unknowns amout of coins. Each coin has a unique ID and one of six denominations. Let set D contins six denominations. In order to guarantee that at least `k + 1` coins have the same denomination, it requires that `size(C) > k * size(D)`. Since `k = 99, size(D) = 6`, it turns out that `size(C) = 99 * 6 = 594`. We need a collcetion of 594 coins.

## 1.9

Let set P contains 25 people and set S contains 3 colorful shirts. Because `25 > 3 * 8`, at least 9 people are wearing the same color. We make another map from these 9 people to 8 classes. Since `9 > 8 * 1`, it turns out that at least two people who wear the same color and are in the same class.
