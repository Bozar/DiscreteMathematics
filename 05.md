# Chapter 5

## 5.1

### (a)

{4, 6}

### (b)

{{8}, {7, 8}, {8, 9}, {7, 8, 9}}

### (c)

{\emptyset}

### (d)

{<1, 0>, <3, 0>, <5, 0>}

### (e)

\emptyset

### (f)

It depends on the way we define the power set.

    {\emptyset, {0}} x {\emptyset, {1}}
    = {
        <emptyset, \emptyset>, <\emptyset, {1}>, <{0}, \emptyset>, <{0}, {1}>
    }

### (g)

{\emptyset, {\emptyset}, {{2}}, {\emptyset, {2}}}

## 5.2

For the left part, an element either belongs to set A, or the shared part of B and C.

For the right part, suppose set U belongs to either A or B, and set V belongs to either A or C, then the shared elements of U and V either belongs to set A, or belongs to the intersection of B and C.

## 5.3

Use Mathematical Induction to prove the statement.

Base case. When n = 1, the power set of A has 2 elements.

Induction hypothesis. Suppose when n = k, k >= 1, the power set of A has 2^k elements.

Induction step. When set A has k elements, we can separate its power set into two parts: the empty set and the rest. By adding a new element x into A, its power set changes accordingly:

    size(A) = n   --> size(a) = n+1
    The empty set --> Remain unchanged.
    The Rest      --> The rest without x, and the rest with x.
    NULL          --> A set with a single element x.

Therefore, the amount of elements is doubled. In other words, size(a) = 2^{n+1}

## 5.4

All the sub sets of A that is either the empty set, or contains two or more elements.

## 5.5

### (a)

Let a = size(A), b = size(B), then according to the statement in 5.3,

    size(powerSet(A x B)) = 2^{ab}                          (1)
    size(powerSet(A)) * size(powerSet(B)) = 2^{a+b}         (2)

    \frac{(2)}{(1)} = 2^{\frac{a+b}{ab}}

If either a or b is 1, (2) > (1). If both a and b are 2, (2) = (1). Otherwise (2) < (1).

### (b)

(DOUBT) Since we cannot find an element that both belongs to and not belongs to set A, and the same statement applies to set B, it seems that the equation is true.

## 5.6

### (a)

{x: x is a real number and is not rational}

### (b)

union({3k: k is an integer}, {5k: k is an integer})

### (c)

union({S_n: S_n is a sub set of X}, n=0, 2^n)

### (d)

{abc: a, b, and c range from 0 to 9}

## 5.7

### (a)

False. The left side is a set with no element. The right side is a set with exactly one element.

### (b)

False. An empty set has no element.

### (c)

True. Since an empty set has no element, its size is 0.

### (d)

False. The power set of an empty set has one element, {\emptyset}.

### (e)

False. Empty set is a set, not an element.

### (f)

True. We cannot find such an integer that is both non-positive and greater than 0.

## 5.8

Let a to represent all elements in set A, that is, A = {a} = {a_1, a_2, ..., a_n}. Similarly, let B = {a, b}, where b represents all elments that belong exclusively to set B. We also have C = {c}, D = {c, d}.

Therefore, A x C = {<a, c>}, B x D = {<a, c>, <a, d>, <b, c>, <b, d>}. If b and d do not exist, then A x C = B x D. Otherwise A x C is a sub set of B x D.

## 5.9

### (a)

Divide all elements into three sets. A' contains all elements that belong exclusively to set A. B' contains all elements that belong exclusively to set B. S are the shared elements between A and B. Therefore,

    union(A, B) = {A', B', S}

    intersection(A, union(A, B))
    = intersection({A', S}, {A', B', S})
    = {A', S}
    = A

### (b)

Let X' represents a set that contains all the elements belong exclusively to set X. Let S_{X, Y} represent a set that contains all the elements shared by set X and Y.

    A = union(A', S_{A, B}, S_{A, C}, S_{A, B, C})
    B = union(B', S_{B, C}, S_{A, B}, S_{A, B, C})
    C = union(C', S_{A, C}, S_{B, C}, S_{A, B, C})

    intersection(B, C) = union(S_{B, C}, S_{A, B, C})       (1)
    A - (1) = union(A', S_{A, B}, S_{A, C})                 (Left)

    A - B = union(A', S_{A, C})                             (2)
    A - C = union(A', S_{A, B})                             (3)
    union((2), (3)) = union(A', S_{A, B}, S_{A, C})         (Right)

It turns out that the left side equals to the right side.

## 5.10

### (a)

Let C, P and B represents students who enroll in chemistry, physics and biology respectively.

    size(C) = C' + S_{C, P} + S_{C, B} + S_{C, P, B} = 60                   (1)
    size(P) = P' + S_{C, P} + S_{P, B} + S_{C, P, B} = 45                   (2)
    size(B) = B' + S_{C, B} + S_{P, B} + S_{C, P, B} = 30                   (3)

    S_{C, P, B} = 10
    C' + P' + B' + S_{C, P} + S_{C, B} + S_{P, B} + S_{C, P, B} = 100       (4)

Let U = C' + P' + B', V = S_{C, P} + S_{C, B} + S_{P, B}.

    (1) + (2) + (3) = U + 2V + 30 = 135
    (4) = U + V = 100

Therefore, V = 15. There are 15 students who are enrolled in exactly two classes.

### (b)

    S_{C, P} + S_{C, B} + S_{P, B} = 15
    S_{C, P} = 9
    S_{P, B} = 4

So S_{C, B} = 2. There are 2 students taking both chemistry and biology.

## 5.11

We have <x, y> = {x, {x, y}}, <u, v> = {u, {u, v}}.

If <x, y> = <u, v>, the two sets must be equal. First, the non-set element x should be equal to u. Then, as for sets {x, y} and {u, v}, since we already have x = u, y must be equal to v for these sets to be equal.

On the other hand, if x = u and y = v, obviously the two sets above have the same elements.
