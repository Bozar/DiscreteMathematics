# Chapter 15

## 15.1

<3549, 462> -> <462, 315> -> <315, 147> -> <147, 21> -> <21, 0>.

## 15.2

Let P = {0, 1, 2, ..., 7}

V = P x P

\sigma = {a1, a2, b1, b2}

A = union(
    {<m, 0> -a1-> <0, m-1>},
    {<m, 0> -a2-> <0, m-2>},
    {<0, m> -b1-> <m-1, 0>},
    {<0, m> -b2-> <m-2, 0>}
), where both m and n belongs to P.

Winning states for the first player:

<2, 0>, <3, 0>, <5, 0>, <6, 0>, <0, 1>, <0, 4>, <0, 7>.

## 15.3

V = <i, o>, where i belongs to {0, 1, 2, 3} and o belongs to {0, 1}.

\sigma = {+1, -1}

A = union(
    {<i, o> - +1 -> <i+1, o>, if i+1 < 4},
    {<i, o> - +1 -> <0, 1>, if i+1 > 3},
    {<i, o> - -1 -> <i-1, o>, if i-1 > -1},
    {<i, o> - -1 -> <3, 1>, if i-1 < 0}
)

## 15.4

Note that d_i refers to the number of tiles that match both criteria:

* Position: They are behind tile i.
* Label: The label j is less than i.

### (a)

When the empty space moves horizontally, the row number r does not change. The relative position and label order of the tiles on row r also remain the same. Therefore D dose not change.

### (b)

    | d_? | d_i | d_j | d_k |
    | d_l |     | d_? | d_? |

When the empty space moves up one row, r decreases by 1.

Consider tiles behind d_i and before the empty space. Suppose there are m tiles whose labels are less than i, and there are n tiles whose labels are greater than i. After the movement, D changes by n-m-1.

Since m+n = 3, we have:

    m  n  n-m  n-m-1
    0  3  3    -1
    1  2  1    0
    2  1  -1   -2
    3  0  -3   -4

All changes are even numbers. Similarly, when the empty space moves down one row, D also changes by an even number.

### (c)

In the start state, D is 0. The state space contains only two labels: move the empty space horizontally or vertically. We have already proved that the first type of movement does not change D, and the second type results in a new D which is also an even number. Therefore D is always even.

### (d)

Suppose this state is reachable. According to the Invariant Principle, D should be even. However, D is 1 in this case. So the state cannot be reached from the given initial state.

## 15.5

Unsolved.

## 15.6

### (a)

Let a = cp + q, b = cr + s.

    (a+b) mod c
    = ((p+r)c + (q+s)) mod c
    = (q+s) mod c

    a mod c = q
    b mod c = s
    ((a mod c) + (b mod c)) mod c = (q+s) mod c

    (a+b) mod c = ((a mod c) + (b mod c)) mod c

### (b)

        0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9
    0	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	0
    1	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	0	1
    2	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	0	1	2
    3	3	4	5	6	7	8	0	1	2	3
    4	4	5	6	7	8	0	1	2	3	4
    5	5	6	7	8	0	1	2	3	4	5
    6	6	7	8	0	1	2	3	4	5	6
    7	7	8	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7
    8	8	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8

### (c)

Unsolved.

### (d)

We represent a two digit integer d as ab, and d = 10a + b. Also note that i mod 9 = i, when i is a non-negeative integer less than 9. In other words, (i mod 9) mod 9 = i mod 9.

    (10a + b) mod 9
    = (9a + (a+b)) mod 9
    =((a+b) mod 9) mod 9
    = (a mod 9 + b mod 9) mod 9
    = (a mod 9 + b) mod 9               (*)

We can expand the equation to an integer with n digits. If r is the remainder of (a mod 9 + b) mod 9, it is also the remainder of the original integer. The equation (*) is exactly what the algorithm does.

## 15.7

V = {<g, p>}, where g belongs to {1, 2, ..., 9}, p belongs to {?, X, O}.

\sigma = {X, O}

A = union({<g, ?> - X -> <g, X>}, {<g, ?> - O -> <g, O>})

The invariant is that the total number of X is either as many as O, or exactly one more than O.

## 15.8

### (a)

(3, 1, 1, 1) -> (4, 2) -> (3, 2, 1) -> (3, 2, 1)

### (b)

(3, 3) -> (2, 2, 2) -> (3, 1, 1, 1) -> (4, 2) -> (3, 2, 1) -> (3, 2, 1)

(5, 1) -> (4, 2)

### (c)

(6, 1) -> (5, 2)
-> (4, 2, 1) -> (3, 3, 1) -> (3, 2, 2) -> (3, 2, 1, 1)
-> (4, 2, 1)

(4, 3) -> (3, 2, 2)

### (d)

For such a stack (n, n-1, ..., 1), first we remove 1 coin from each pile and results in n-1 piles (n-1, n-2, ..., 1), next we add a new pile with n coins. The final result remains unchanged.

### (e)

Suppose the state (n, n-1, ..., 1) is reachable for a stack of `\sigma^{n}_{i=1}{i}` coins. Next we add n+1 coins to the stack and mark them as black. We do not remove black coins from the initial stack. Therefore the tansitions behave as if the total number of coins is not changed. When the initial stack contians only black coins, the configuration is (n+1, n, n-1, ..., 1). This shows that we can start from a pile of `\sigma^{n}_{i=1}{i}` coins and ends with a repeat pattern.
