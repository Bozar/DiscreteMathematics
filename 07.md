# Chapter 7

## 7.1

Let N_0 be the set of non-negative integers. N_1 = union({-1}, N_0). There is an injection from N_0 to N_1, but N_1 has an element -1 which does not exist in N_0. Therefore, N_1 is larger than N_0. Similarly, let N_2 = union({-2}, N_1). We can create countably many sets by adding just one more negative integer to an existing set. All sets created this way have countably infinite elements and are of different sizes.

## 7.2

Sort these sets first by length, then by alphabetical order. Since all the strings have a finit length, for any given length n, there are 26^n different combinations, which is a finite number. So we can use natural numbers to label every such combination, starting from 0. This means the sets are countable.

## 7.3

Let S be the set of characteristic functions and T = union({d}, S), where d is not included in S. This means that there is an injection from S to T, but the map from S to T is not surjective. Since we suppose that there is a bijection from the set of natural numbers to S, and the size of T is larger than S, we cannot use natural numbers to enumerate all elements in T.

## 7.4

### (a)

Both A and B are the set of natural numbers.

### (b)

A is the set of integers. B is the set of integers excluding 0.

### (c)

A is the set of even integers. B is the set of odd integers.

### (d)

A is the set of natural numbers. B is the power set of negative integers.

## 7.5

### (a)

Let set A be the power set of the set of natural numbers. B is the same as A excluding one element: {0}. Both A and B are uncountable, but A - B = {0}, which is countable.

### (b)

Suppose set A is the set of integers, and B is the set of even integers. A - B is the set of odd integers, which is countably infinite.

### (c)

Suppose A = {0}, then the power set of A is {\emptyset, {0}}, and it is countable.

### (d)

Suppose there are countably infinite sets. Each of them contains exactly one unique natural number: {0}, {1}, {2}, ..., {n}. Therefore the union of them is the set of natural numbers itself and it is countably infinite.

### (e)

Impossible. Create a dictionary in which the keys are natural numbers, and the values are set elements. The first element is linked with key 0. Following elements are added in this way. If the element is unique, link it with the smallest unoccupied key. Otherwise do nothing. Since every set has finite elements, we can use finite number-element pairs to store all elements. This means that the union set has finite elements, so it is not uncountable.

### (f)

Suppose A is the power set of even integers and B is the power set of odd integers. The intersection of A and B is empty.

## 7.6

Suppose the set of real numbers between 0 and 1 is countably infinite. Let's focus on the fractional part and represent every decimal integer by a 4-digit binary number. For example, 0 is 0b0000, 9 is 0b1001. Below are some more examples:

    0.1  -> 0001 0000 0000 ...
    0.93 -> 1001 0010 0000 ...

Every four digits is a segment. We can change them diagonally by flipping the last digit from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0. In this way we shall get a new real number that is different from existing ones. So there is at least one element that is not mapped by natural numbers and it also means that the set is uncountable.

## 7.7

### (a)

First, we represent a real number between 0 and 0.9... as a series of binary numbers as in 7.6 to avoid the fact that 0.1 and 0.09... are the same decimal number. Next, we shall create a dictionary for the ordered pairs of reals between 0 and 1. We use the left part as the key and the pair itself as the value. For any ordered pair, if the key does not exist in our dictionary, we simply add the key-value pair to the dictionary. Otherwise, we have to generate a new key in the following way. Suppose we have a matrix of all existing keys:

    0001 0010 0000 0000 ...
    1001 0000 0100 0010 ...
    0011 0110 1000 0000 ...
    0101 1000 0000 0100 ...

We use S_{i,j} to represent the binary segment in the i-th row and j-th column. In order to generate a new key, we flip the last digit in S_{i,j} of all keys. In the case mentioned above, we have

    0000 0001 1001 0101 ...

The new key is different from existing ones and it cannot be greater than 0.9... because we only alter the last digit and 8 and 9 are 0b1000 and 0b1001 respectively. In this way, all the order pairs points to a unique real number between 0 and 1. In other words, there is a injection from the set of order pairs to the set of real numbers.

Suppose there is a real number x that is not mapped by any order pairs. According to the definition of cross product, x must appear as the left part in some ordered pairs. So x is either used as the key directly or generated from existing keys. This is a contradiction to our assumption. So the map is surjective.

In conclusion, there is a bijection from [0,1] x [0,1] to [0,1].

### (b)

By removing the decimal point, we can represent an non-negative real number in  binary form as above. Following the same procedure, we can show that there is a bijection from the ordered pairs of non-negative real numbers to non-negative real numbers.

## 7.8

We need to find a function with two arguments such that f(x,y) = z. Note that for a given x+y, the number of order pairs is finite. And when x+y is 0, 1, 2, and 3, the starting index is 0, 1, 3 and 6 respectively.

    x+y pairs index
    0   1     0
    1   2     1
    2   3     3
    3   4     6

We can conclude two things from the table above. First, every x+y has x+y+1 pairs. Second, let L=x+y, the starting index is S=1+2+3+...+L. In other words, the natural number for <0, L> is S. Therefore,

    f(0,L) = \frac{(L+1)*L}{2}

    f(x,y) = \frac{(L+1)*L}{2} + x
    L = x + y
