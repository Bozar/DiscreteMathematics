# Chapter 5

## 5.1

### (a)

{4, 6}

### (b)

{{8}, {7, 8}, {8, 9}, {7, 8, 9}}

### (c)

{\emptyset}

### (d)

{<1, 0>, <3, 0>, <5, 0>}

### (e)

\emptyset

### (f)

It depends on the way we define the power set.

    {\emptyset, {0}} x {\emptyset, {1}}
    = {
        <emptyset, \emptyset>, <\emptyset, {1}>, <{0}, \emptyset>, <{0}, {1}>
    }

### (g)

{\emptyset, {\emptyset}, {{2}}, {\emptyset, {2}}}

## 5.2

For the left part, an element either belongs to set A, or the shared part of B and C.

For the right part, suppose set U belongs to either A or B, and set V belongs to either A or C, then the shared elements of U and V either belongs to set A, or belongs to the intersection of B and C.

## 5.3

Use Mathematical Induction to prove the statement.

Base case. When n = 1, the power set of A has 2 elements.

Induction hypothesis. Suppose when n = k, k >= 1, the power set of A has 2^k elements.

Induction step. When set A has k elements, we can separate its power set into two parts: the empty set and the rest. By adding a new element x into A, its power set changes accordingly:

    size(A) = n   --> size(a) = n+1
    The empty set --> Remain unchanged.
    The Rest      --> The rest without x, and the rest with x.
    NULL          --> A set with a single element x.

Therefore, the amount of elements is doubled. In other words, size(a) = 2^{n+1}

## 5.4

All the sub sets of A that is either the empty set, or contains two or more elements.

## 5.5

### (a)

Let a = size(A), b = size(B), then according to the statement in 5.3,

    size(powerSet(A x B)) = 2^{ab}                          (1)
    size(powerSet(A)) * size(powerSet(B)) = 2^{a+b}         (2)

    \frac{(2)}{(1)} = 2^{\frac{a+b}{ab}}

If either a or b is 1, (2) > (1). If both a and b are 2, (2) = (1). Otherwise (2) < (1).

### (b)

(DOUBT) Since we cannot find an element that both belongs to and not belongs to set A, and the same statement applies to set B, it seems that the equation is true.
