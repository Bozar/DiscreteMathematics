# Chapter 7

## 7.1

Let N_0 be the set of non-negative integers. N_1 = union({-1}, N_0). There is an injection from N_0 to N_1, but N_1 has an element -1 which does not exist in N_0. Therefore, N_1 is larger than N_0. Similarly, let N_2 = union({-2}, N_1). We can create countably many sets by adding just one more negative integer to an existing set. All sets created this way have countably infinite elements and are of different sizes.

## 7.2

Sort these sets first by length, then by alphabetical order. Since all the strings have a finit length, for any given length n, there are 26^n different combinations, which is a finite number. So we can use natural numbers to label every such combination, starting from 0. This means the sets are countable.

## 7.3

Let S be the set of characteristic functions and T = union({d}, S), where d is not included in S. This means that there is an injection from S to T, but the map from S to T is not surjective. Since we suppose that there is a bijection from the set of natural numbers to S, and the size of T is larger than S, we cannot use natural numbers to enumerate all elements in T.

## 7.4

### (a)

Both A and B are the set of natural numbers.

### (b)

A is the set of integers. B is the set of integers excluding 0.

### (c)

A is the set of even integers. B is the set of odd integers.

### (d)

A is the set of natural numbers. B is the power set of negative integers.

## 7.5

### (a)

Let set A be the power set of the set of natural numbers. B is the same as A excluding one element: {0}. Both A and B are uncountable, but A - B = {0}, which is countable.

### (b)

Suppose set A is the set of integers, and B is the set of even integers. A - B is the set of odd integers, which is countably infinite.

### (c)

Suppose A = {0}, then the power set of A is {\emptyset, {0}}, and it is countable.

### (d)

Suppose there are countably infinite sets. Each of them contains exactly one unique natural number: {0}, {1}, {2}, ..., {n}. Therefore the union of them is the set of natural numbers itself and it is countably infinite.

### (e)

Impossible. Create a dictionary in which the keys are natural numbers, and the values are set elements. The first element is linked with key 0. Following elements are added in this way. If the element is unique, link it with the smallest unoccupied key. Otherwise do nothing. Since every set has finite elements, we can use finite number-element pairs to store all elements. This means that the union set has finite elements, so it is not uncountable.

### (f)

Suppose A is the power set of even integers and B is the power set of odd integers. The intersection of A and B is empty.

## 7.6

Suppose the set of real numbers between 0 and 1 is countably infinite. Let's focus on the fractional part and represent every decimal integer by a 4-digit binary number. For example, 0 is 0b0000, 9 is 0b1001. Below are some more examples:

    0.1  -> 0001 0000 0000 ...
    0.93 -> 1001 0010 0000 ...

Every four digits is a segment. We can change them diagonally by flipping the last digit from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0. In this way we shall get a new real number that is different from existing ones. So there is at least one element that is not mapped by natural numbers and it also means that the set is uncountable.

## 7.7

### (a)

First, we represent a real number between 0 and 0.9... as a series of binary numbers as in 7.6 to avoid the fact that 0.1 and 0.09... are the same decimal number. Next, we shall create a dictionary for the ordered pairs of reals between 0 and 1. We use the left part as the key and the pair itself as the value. For any ordered pair, if the key does not exist in our dictionary, we simply add the key-value pair to the dictionary. Otherwise, we have to generate a new key in the following way. Suppose we have a matrix of all existing keys:

    0001 0010 0000 0000 ...
    1001 0000 0100 0010 ...
    0011 0110 1000 0000 ...
    0101 1000 0000 0100 ...

We use S_{i,j} to represent the binary segment in the i-th row and j-th column. In order to generate a new key, we flip the last digit in S_{i,j} of all keys. In the case mentioned above, we have

    0000 0001 1001 0101 ...

The new key is different from existing ones and it cannot be greater than 0.9... because we only alter the last digit and 8 and 9 are 0b1000 and 0b1001 respectively. In this way, all the order pairs points to a unique real number between 0 and 1. In other words, there is a injection from the set of order pairs to the set of real numbers.

Suppose there is a real number x that is not mapped by any order pairs. According to the definition of cross product, x must appear as the left part in some ordered pairs. So x is either used as the key directly or generated from existing keys. This is a contradiction to our assumption. So the map is surjective.

In conclusion, there is a bijection from [0,1] x [0,1] to [0,1].

### (b)

By removing the decimal point, we can represent an non-negative real number in  binary form as above. Following the same procedure, we can show that there is a bijection from the ordered pairs of non-negative real numbers to non-negative real numbers.

## 7.8

We need to find a function with two arguments such that f(x,y) = z. Note that for a given x+y, the number of order pairs is finite. And when x+y is 0, 1, 2, and 3, the starting index is 0, 1, 3 and 6 respectively.

    x+y pairs index
    0   1     0
    1   2     1
    2   3     3
    3   4     6

We can conclude two things from the table above. First, every x+y has x+y+1 pairs. Second, let L=x+y, the starting index is S=1+2+3+...+L. In other words, the natural number for <0, L> is S. Therefore,

    f(0,L) = \frac{(L+1)*L}{2}

    f(x,y) = \frac{(L+1)*L}{2} + x
    L = x + y

## 7.9

### (a)

Countably infinite. Suppose the set of all books is finite and the max sequence length is N, because N is a natural number, we can generate a new book of length N+1. The new book is different from existing books. Therefore the set has infinite elements.

In order to build a bijection from natural numbers to the set, first we sort these books by length. For any given finite length, the number of books is also finite. So we can sort books of a given length by alphabetical order and map them by a finite amount of natural numbers.

### (b)

Finite. Here is a string containing at most 500,000 characters. Every character has at most N possibilites. So there are 500,000^N possible books.

### (c)

Countably infinite. Sort these sets by the length of sequence:

    0: {\emptyset}
    1: {{a}, {b}, {c}, ...}
    2: {{ab}, {ac}, {ad}, ...}

The length is infinite but there is a bijection from natural numbers to the all finite sets of books.

### (d)

Uncountable. We have proved in 7.7 that the real numbers between 0 and 1 are uncountable. According to lemma 7.9.1, the rational numbers between 0 and 1 are countably infinite. If the irrational numbers between 0 and 1 are also countably infinite, we have two functions:

    f(n) -> rational numbers
    g(n) -> irrational numbers

Let p=2n and q=2n+1,

    f(p) -> rational numbers
    g(q) -> irrational numbers

It turns out that there is a bijecton from natural numbers to rational numbers, which is contradict to our assumption. So the irrational numbers between 0 and 1 are uncountable.

Lemma 7.9.1: The rational numbers between 0 and 1 are countably infinite.

We can represent a rational number as p/q, where p and q are natural numbers, q != 0 and p < q. We can always generate a new p/q by replacing q with q+1, so there are infinite rational numbers ranging from 0 to 1. For any given p + q, the combinitions of p and q are finite. So we can sort all p/q first by p + q, then p and q in ascending order. In this way we form a bijection from natural numbers to rational numbers between 0 and 1.

### (e)

Uncountable. Numbers that are divisible by 17 can be written as 17N, where N is a natural number. There is a bijection from the power set of natural numbers P to Q, the set of all sets of 17N. Since P is uncountable, so is Q.

### (f)

Countable. The only even prime number is 2. The set of all sets of even prime number is {{2}}.

### (g)

Uncountable. Powers of 2 can be represented as 2^N, where N is a natural number. In a similar way as 7.9(e), the set of all sets of 2^N is uncountable.

### (h)

Finite. There are only two such functions:

    f(x) = 0
    g(x) = 1

The set required is {f(x), g(x)}.

## 7.10

### (a)

Because there are infinite sets of a given size. For example, {0}, {1}, {2}, ... .

### (b)

Let S be the sum of a given sub set. We can use a binary string to represent elements in the set. The max length of the string is S. For example, let S = 3,

    {1, 2}: 011
    {0, 1, 2}: 111
    {3}: 0001
    {0, 3}: 1001

Sort these string first by length, then by compaing their digits.

### (c)

If there are infinite elements in a sub set, consider the longest binary string for a given S. Add 1 to the end and flip previous 1s to 0s to keep the sum unchanged. The new string is different from existing ones. This means that we need to use all the natural numbers to map all subsets of a given sum S with infinte elements. Subsets of a different sum cannot be mapped by natural numbers. In other words, all subsets of the natural number set are uncountable.

## 7.11

Any countably infinite sets can be mapped by natural numbers:

    S_1 = {f(0), f(1), f(2), ...}
    S_2 = {g(0), g(1), g(2), ...}
    S_3 = {h(0), h(1), h(2), ...}

Now let's consider the union of k countably infinite sets. We map natural numbers used by f, g, h to a different set of numbers:

    f: 0, k, 2k, ...
    g: 1, k+1, 2k+1, ...
    h: 2, k+2, 2k+2, ...

We can reuse an index in S_1 if S_1 and S_2 share a common element. Even if all sets have unique elements, we can still use natural numbers to map all elements as mentioned above.

## 7.12

### (a)

For all functions in the statement, the size of its image could either be 1 or 2. Let's suppose all these images form a set S. According to Theorem 7.5, S is countable. Therefore, all functions that links the domain {0, 1} to its image are countable.

### (b)

Unknown.
