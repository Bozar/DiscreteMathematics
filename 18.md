# Chapter 18

## 18.1

The graph has a 3-colorable.

    1:r, 3:g, 5:r, 4:g, 2:b
    6:g, 8:b, 7:g

We can replace any vertex with a fourth color.

2-5-4 is an odd length cycle, so 2-coloring cannot exist.

## 18.2

The chromatic number is n-1. In a complete graph, every vertex must have a different color from all other vertices. Suppose an edge connects two vertices, red and green. By removing the edge, we can re-color the green vertex with red, and the original red vertex remains unchanged. This shows that we need n-1 colors for a K_n - e graph.
