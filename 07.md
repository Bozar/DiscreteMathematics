# Chapter 7

## 7.1

Let N_0 be the set of non-negative integers. N_1 = union({-1}, N_0). There is an injection from N_0 to N_1, but N_1 has an element -1 which does not exist in N_0. Therefore, N_1 is larger than N_0. Similarly, let N_2 = union({-2}, N_1). We can create countably many sets by adding just one more negative integer to an existing set. All sets created this way have countably infinite elements and are of different sizes.

## 7.2

Sort these sets first by length, then by alphabetical order. Since all the strings have a finit length, for any given length n, there are 26^n different combinations, which is a finite number. So we can use natural numbers to label every such combination, starting from 0. This means the sets are countable.

## 7.3

Let S be the set of characteristic functions and T = union({d}, S), where d is not included in S. This means that there is an injection from S to T, but the map from S to T is not surjective. Since we suppose that there is a bijection from the set of natural numbers to S, and the size of T is larger than S, we cannot use natural numbers to enumerate all elements in T.

## 7.4

### (a)

Both A and B are the set of natural numbers.

### (b)

A is the set of integers. B is the set of integers excluding 0.

### (c)

A is the set of even integers. B is the set of odd integers.

### (d)

A is the set of natural numbers. B is the power set of negative integers.
