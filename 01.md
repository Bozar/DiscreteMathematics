# Chapter 1

## 1.2

Let `x = p_1 * p_2 ... p_n` and `y = x * p_(n-1)`. It satisifies `x < y` and `f(x) > f(y)`.

For example, `x = 2 * 3 = 6` and `y = 2 * 3 * 2 = 12`.

## 1.3

If x is an integer, `floor(x) == ceil(x)`.

Otherwise, suppose `x = m + p/q`, in which x, m, p and q are integers and `p < q`. We have `floor(x) = m` and `ceil(x) = m + 1`, which meets the requirement.

## 1.4

Let's consider two 1-dimension rows A & B: `A: [1, 2], B: [1, 2, 3]`. Obviously in row B, we cannot guarantee that after the movement, all holes have at most one pigeon.

* We define a neighbor as a list which contains two adjacent grids. For example, `[1, 2]` and `[2, 3]` are neighbors in row B.
* If we join k neighbors (which form set N) into one row and add a single grid at the end, we will get a row which has `2k + 1` grids. We fill all these grids with pigeons and they form set P.
* We define a map from P to N following these rules:
    * A pigeon must move one step.
    * If its current position is included in a neighbor, it moves into the other grid defined by the neighbor.
    * Otherwise, it moves into a grid in a neighbor which has the minimum value.
* Since `2k + 1 > k * 2`, The Extended Pigeonhole Principle states that there are at least 3 pigeons moving into the same neighbor, which has only 2 grids. This ends up two pigeons in one hole.

A 2-dimension square has `(2k + 1)^2` grids. Each row has k neighbors, and there are `2k + 1` rows in all. (Note that neighbors should not overlap with each other.) For the last column, we pack neighbors vertically and there are k of them. So we have `k * (2k + 1) + k = 2k^2 + 2k` neighbors in all. Since `size(P) = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1` and `size(N) = 2k^2 + 2k`, we can conclude that `size(P) > size(N) * 2`. As we have discussed above, this shows that there will be two pigeons in one hole.
