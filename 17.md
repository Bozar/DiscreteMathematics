# Chapter 17

## 17.1

The edge connectivity is n-2. The vertex connectivity is n-1.

## 17.2

Two edge-disjoint paths might start from and end with the same vertices.

If there are two paths that share no vertex along the way, it turns out that v_i-v_{i+1} from the first path can never appear in the second path. In other words, these two paths are also edge-disjoint.

## 17.3

A minimum-size <s, t>-edge-cut includes four edges that are connected directly to vertex s.

## 17.4

When a complete graph has two vertices, both the edge connectivity and vertex connectivity are 1. Suppose the statement holds true for any graph with n-1 vertices. We only need to consider edges that start from the Nth vertex p, because the hypothesis guarantees that no matter how n-1 vertices are connected, the statement always is true.

If p is not connected to any vertex, both the edge connectivity and vertex connectivity are 0. Whenever we add a new edge between p and an existing vertex, both the edge connectivity and vertex connectivity increase by 1. However, they cannot be greater than e and v, where e and v are the edge connectivity and vertex connectivity of the graph with n-1 vertices. According to the hypothesis, we have e <= v. This shows that the statement is true for all graphs.
