# Chapter 22

## 22.1

### (a)

Alphabet a can be shifted at most 25 steps. So there are 25 different ciphers.

### (b)

Every alphabet has 26 replacements. So there are 26^2 different ciphers.

### (c)

5^2*21^2 = 11025

## 22.2

### (a)

    4*3*5 = 60

### (b)

    4*3*5-2*1*5 = 50

## 22.3

### (a)

8!

### (b)

    MISSISSIPPI: {<M, 1>, <I, 4>, <S, 4>, <P, 2>}

    \frac{11!}{4!*4!*2!} = 34650

## 22.4

Suppose there are N permutations that none of them can be transformed by rotation and/or reversal to another. For every permutation, there are 5 transformed arranagements. Since N*5 = 5!, we have N = 24.
