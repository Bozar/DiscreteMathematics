# Chapter 7

## 7.1

Let N_0 be the set of non-negative integers. N_1 = union({-1}, N_0). There is an injection from N_0 to N_1, but N_1 has an element -1 which does not exist in N_0. Therefore, N_1 is larger than N_0. Similarly, let N_2 = union({-2}, N_1). We can create countably many sets by adding just one more negative integer to an existing set. All sets created this way have countably infinite elements and are of different sizes.

## 7.2

Sort these sets first by length, then by alphabetical order. Since all the strings have a finit length, for any given length n, there are 26^n different combinations, which is a finite number. So we can use natural numbers to label every such combination, starting from 0. This means the sets are countable.

## 7.3

Let S be the set of characteristic functions and T = union({d}, S), where d is not included in S. This means that there is an injection from S to T, but the map from S to T is not surjective. Since we suppose that there is a bijection from the set of natural numbers to S, and the size of T is larger than S, we cannot use natural numbers to enumerate all elements in T.

## 7.4

### (a)

Both A and B are the set of natural numbers.

### (b)

A is the set of integers. B is the set of integers excluding 0.

### (c)

A is the set of even integers. B is the set of odd integers.

### (d)

A is the set of natural numbers. B is the power set of negative integers.

## 7.5

### (a)

Let set A be the power set of the set of natural numbers. B is the same as A excluding one element: {0}. Both A and B are uncountable, but A - B = {0}, which is countable.

### (b)

Suppose set A is the set of integers, and B is the set of even integers. A - B is the set of odd integers, which is countably infinite.

### (c)

Suppose A = {0}, then the power set of A is {\emptyset, {0}}, and it is countable.

### (d)

Suppose there are countably infinite sets. Each of them contains exactly one unique natural number: {0}, {1}, {2}, ..., {n}. Therefore the union of them is the set of natural numbers itself and it is countably infinite.

### (e)

Impossible. Create a dictionary in which the keys are natural numbers, and the values are set elements. The first element is linked with key 0. Following elements are added in this way. If the element is unique, link it with the smallest unoccupied key. Otherwise do nothing. Since every set has finite elements, we can use finite number-element pairs to store all elements. This means that the union set has finite elements, so it is not uncountable.

### (f)

Suppose A is the power set of even integers and B is the power set of odd integers. The intersection of A and B is empty.

## 7.6

Suppose the set of real numbers between 0 and 1 is countably infinite. Let's focus on the fractional part and represent every decimal integer by a 4-digit binary number. For example, 0 is 0b0000, 9 is 0b1001. Below are some more examples:

    0.1  -> 0001 0000 0000 ...
    0.93 -> 1001 0010 0000 ...

Every four digits is a segment. We can change them diagonally by flipping the last digit from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0. In this way we shall get a new real number that is different from existing ones. So there is at least one element that is not mapped by natural numbers and it also means that the set is uncountable.
